A personal portfolio featuring my photography work.

Technologies used:

- [Angular2+ (ver 17.1.0)](https://angular.dev/)
- [NgRx (ver 17.0.1)](https://ngrx.io/) Yes, it is an overkill for what I needed this app to do.
- [Rxjs (ver 6.6.3)](https://rxjs.dev/)
- [Bootstrap (ver 4.6.0)](https://getbootstrap.com/) => in-progress of removing it from individual components to complete removal of the library to use pure css.
- [Animate.css](https://animate.style/) => Will eventually move away from this library and maybe make use of just [Angular animations](https://angular.io/guide/animations/) OR pure css, haven't decided yet.
- [Github actions](https://github.com/features/actions/) => To automate deployment of code to AWS
- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
- [AWS Cloudfront (CDN)](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)
- [AWS Route 53 (DNS service) ](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)
